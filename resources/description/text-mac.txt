Pasteboard

Description

Pasteboard is the simplest way to move text snippets from device to device.

Copy text with one click from your Mac to the iPhone, iPad or another Mac.

Syncing happens wirelessly over your local network - so you don't even need internet access.

Don't be frustrated by bloated preferences - adding and removing devices is dead simple.

From day one we offer you uniquely integrated Pasteboard versions for the Mac, iPhone and iPad.

Never have to suffer e-mail again to get a simple web link from the iPhone to your Mac.
